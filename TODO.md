----------TODO FEATURES ----------

-   [ ] We need to think again on how money manager actually works because it's really complicated and it's un-necessary to have so many features, we could just have a simple money manager that just
        changes quantity based on the index and day of the week.
-   [ ] Positions Page should fetch data from the database not from broker API.
-   [ ] Orders Page should fetch data from the database not from broker API.
-   [ ] Trades Page should fetch data from the database not from broker API.

-   [ ] We need to add a system so that the positions manually closed by the user are marked as closed in the database.
-   [ ] We need to add feature that can take control of manually added positions and close them automatically based previously set parameters.
-   [ ] We need to add different types of trailing stop loos systems that we have previously worked on.
-   [ ] We need to make dragger positions widget more informative and useful.

----------TODO BUGS ----------

-   [ ] Alerts not working as intended, need to fix it.
